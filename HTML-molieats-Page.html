        New modelling details
    </a> show additional public health measures could bring that number down closer to 10,000, sources say, however those measures would have to be considerably more restrictive to curb the rate of infection.

    The modelling also shows up to 1,800 patients in intensive care by the end of May, according to the sources.

    Projections released by the province two weeks ago had forecast up to 12,000 new cases per day with around 800-1,000 people in ICU by the end of April.

    The Ontario cabinet is also considering the following proposals, which have not yet been formally approved:

    Closing all non-essential retail, no curbside pick-up or delivery.
    Further restricting retail hours of operation.
    Restricting curbside pick-up (only permit non-essential retail to deliver).
    Shutting down non-essential construction, warehouses and manufacturing not related to health, food or automotive.
